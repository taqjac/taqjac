Hello, I’m Tiago. 👋

I'm a researcher at [CINTESIS](https://cintesis.eu/pt/homepage/) and a lecturer at [FMUP](http://med.up.pt) and [ESS](http://ess.ipp.pt).

I was born in Coimbra and work in Porto, Portugal.

I'm interested in respiratory physiology, digital health and scientific methodology and writing.
